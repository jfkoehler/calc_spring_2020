    "- University Libraries: http://library.newschool.eduhttp://library.newschool.edu/\n",
    "- University Learning Center: http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center \n",
    "- University Disabilities Service: www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/   In keeping with the university’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to contact Student Disability Service (SDS). SDS will conduct an intake and, if appropriate, the Director will provide an academic accommodation notification letter for you to bring to me. At that point, I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course.\n",

    "\n",
    "The focus of this course is to simultaneously introduce the conceptual elements of calculus while also putting these ideas to use in real applications.  We will regularly use technology to perform computations as well as to access real world data.  Class will typically begin with a short lecture overview of the days topic, and this will be followed by weekly class problem sets that will be completed for homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the course students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe and develop the idea of a definite and indefinite integral\n",
    "- Use Definite Integrals to solve problems of area and volume\n",
    "- Use Integration to solve problems related to statistics and probability \n",
    "- Use Summations to approximate definite integrals and solve problems from statistics and probability\n",
    "- Describe and develop the idea of a derivative\n",
    "- Find derivatives of polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, and radial functions\n",
    "- Use derivatives to solve optimization problems\n",
    "- Find partial derivatives of functions of several variables\n",
    "- Use derivatives to develop regression models\n",
    "- Connect differentiation and integration through the fundamental theorem of calculus\n",
    "- Solve basic separable differential equations\n",
    "- Approximate solutions to differential equations using Euler's method\n",

    "Students are expected to attend all classes and complete all assignments.  Additionally, students are expected to arrive prepared for class having completed all reading, problem, and watching assignments.  During class, students are expected to contribute to discussions and problem solving group work.  We will have weekly homework assignments and three examinations.  Late assignments will not be accepted.  In addition to our assignments and exams, we will have a take home final examination.  Your grade will be determined by the following:\n",
