    "1. Draw a rectangle with two sides that are determined by some arbitrary functions $h(x)$ and $w(x)$, that represent the width and height of the figure.\n",
    "    - Extend each side by a small amount; $dh$ and $dw$ respectively.\n",
    "    - Write a function $A(x)$ to represent the area of the rectangle in terms of functions $h$ and $w$.\n",
    "    - Compute the value of the larger rectangle\n",
    "    - How will the value of the corner piece $dh \\times dw$ compare to our others?  Do we need it?\n",
    "    - Make an argument for dismissing this piece, and write your new expression.\n",
    "    - Use the **product rule** to find the derivative of $A(x)$, compare this to your expression above.  What's going on here?\n",

    "6. String Art Redux.  For this problem, I would like you to draw a picture that would result from placing a peg at the positive $x$ and $y$ values $[0, 6]$.  Draw a line between $x$ and $y$ values that add to 6.  For example from $x = 1$ and $y = 5$.  \n",
